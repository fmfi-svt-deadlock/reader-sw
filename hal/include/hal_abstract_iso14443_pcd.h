 * @brief   Abstract ISO14443 Proximity Coupling Device (card reader) driver
 *          interface.
 * @details This header defines an abstract interface useful to access generic
 *          ISO14443-compliant PCDs (contactless card readers) in a
 *          standardized way.
 *
 * @addtogroup ISO14443_PCD
 * @details This module defines an abstract interface for using
 *          ISO14443-compliant PCDs.<br>
 *          Note that no code is present, just abstract interfaces-like
 *          structures, you should look at the system as to a set of
 *          abstract C++ classes (even if written in C). This system
 *          has then advantage to make the access to block devices
 *          independent from the implementation logic.
